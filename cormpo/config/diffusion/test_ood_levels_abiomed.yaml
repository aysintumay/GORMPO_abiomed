# Diffusion OOD Distance Levels Testing Configuration for Abiomed
# Tests model performance at different OOD distance levels

# Model directory (where checkpoint.pt and scheduler/ are located)
model_dir: checkpoints/diffusion

# Dataset settings
dataset_name: abiomed
base_path: /public/gormpo/ood_test

# OOD distance levels to test
# Lower distances (0.5, 1) = small shifts, harder to detect
# Medium distances (2, 4) = moderate shifts
# Higher distances (8) = large shifts, easier to detect
distances: [0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Hardware
device: cuda
devid: 0

# Processing parameters
batch_size: 100  # Small batch size to avoid OOM with ELBO computation
num_inference_steps: 20  # Fast ELBO (20 steps vs full 1000)

# Optional: Set anomaly fraction for threshold (if needed for accuracy computation)
# This can be set from a separate validation run
anomaly_fraction: 0.01  # 1% percentile
